_In 2017, BaoTa tried to enter the overseas market, but because the number of people could not keep up, he decided to temporarily abandon the overseas market and focus on China._

_In 2019, due to the gradual growth of BaoTa users, which has become the hosting control panel used by the most webmasters in China, it is decided to enter the overseas market and develop related plug-ins that are suitable for foreign friends___
